# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Entries here are the macro history, always in English. Full technical detail for each change lives in the OKF catalog under [`knowledge/changes/`](knowledge/changes/).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- Operator console occupancy is theater presence after dropping stale `left_at IS NULL` rows (crashed tabs / API restart). KPI cards explain each number. Operators can factory-reset theater rooms and metrics with a typed confirmation phrase; operator accounts stay. Guest theater API is unchanged.
- Operator console on a separate bind/port (`ADMIN_PORT` 3002): Mantine SPA, `/api/admin/*`, occupancy and peak members, LiveKit `/metrics` scrape plus OME REST samples (no Prometheus server). Guest theater API is unchanged.
- **What is Amphitheatre?** (`/what-is`) and **About** (`/about`) explain the product in plain language (no competing product names). Copy sits in a readable column, not a glass card.
- Settings → General can request microphone and camera access on tap, with copy for Safari and iOS when the prompt never appears.

### Changed

- `/about` is centered like the missing-room screen. Copy states it is open source (self-host and contribute). Buy me a coffee is the primary button; GitHub is outline. The four open-source tools sit in a named grid. No “open a room” CTA on this page.
- `GET /api/rooms/:id` returns a preview for existing private rooms so invite links open the join screen instead of a fake 404. Join of a missing room is `not_found`; a wrong password is `invalid_password` on public and private rooms.
- The Home room-code field keeps mixed case (room ids are case-sensitive) and does not auto-capitalize on mobile.

### Fixed

- Occupied rooms / people now counted members who never called leave (SQLite `left_at` null), including after a closed tab or API restart.
- Operator console password field on the Operators page crashed with `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'value')` and was too small to use.
- Safari/mobile often failed mic and camera with a permission error without showing a prompt: capture no longer waits on `startAudio()` first, and Devices camera preview starts only after a tap.
- Joining a non-existent room from Home no longer shows “password does not match”. Joining without a display name asks for a name.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- Screen share can include tab or system audio (Chromium picker). If the browser rejects the audio constraint, share continues as video-only.
- Progressive Web App: web app manifest, Apple install meta, production service worker (network passthrough so Chromium can install), and app icons on a `#2e1b08` canvas (maskable + any). Compact Home always suggests installing; the hamburger and Settings → General offer Install as app until the session is already standalone.
- Invite uses the device share sheet (`navigator.share`) with title and text in the active UI locale; the room URL is in the text. Clipboard copy is the fallback.

### Fixed

- LiveKit voice was silent for everyone even when the speaking indicator lit up: remote audio tracks are now attached and autoplay is unlocked (`room.startAudio()` plus an enable-audio prompt).
- Deploy Compose now passes `OME_API_ACCESS_TOKEN` into the OvenMediaEngine container, matching `<AccessToken>` in `Server.xml`, so the app can poll whether a stream is live.
- YouTube stage embeds failed with Error 153 (HTTP Referer): Hono was sending `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`. The API, the iframe, and the HTML meta now use `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`. The iframe no longer adds an `origin=` query param (that is for the IFrame Player API, not a plain embed).

### Changed

- Mobile Home and room chrome: header is wordmark + Settings + an appearance menu (theme and language); the media dock is a full-width floating bar at the bottom with icon-only buttons; an offline broadcast message sizes to its content instead of sitting inside the video tile; microphone test shows a level meter, mutes the room mic while you listen to yourself, and restores the previous mute state.
- Home compact layout: hero and mood chips are centered; join/create are tabs (join first); the hamburger opens a fullscreen appearance sheet with a close button; the guest avatar lives inside that sheet.
- Desktop empty stage (“the stage is yours”) is centered in the stage frame.
- Room QOL: Settings-only header; General tab for theme and language; unread chat badge and `(n)` document title; mobile Settings is fullscreen; Audience/Chat is a bottom drawer; mobile cameras use a 1–2 column grid.
- Settings chrome: tighter flood-pause spacing; Devices is a two-column Discord-style grid on desktop; About shows the root `package.json` version (same as the GitHub Release tag); mobile room title left / broadcast badge right; Audience/Chat tabs share the drawer card and use the panel corner radius.
- About credits the author as a link to sims.dev.br. Source on GitHub is an outline button; Buy me a coffee is the filled primary. The Portfolio button is gone.
- Open Graph / Twitter use `summary_large_image` with 1200×630 dimensions and alt text. The GitHub `canonical` link is gone so crawlers treat the live origin as the page URL.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- Initial monorepo bootstrap: `apps/api` (Hono/Bun), `apps/web` (Vite/React), `packages/shared`, and the Docker Compose infra (LiveKit, Valkey, optional OvenMediaEngine).
- Guest JWT identity (no accounts); persistent room roles (`owner` > `admin` > `moderator` > `member`); immutable room ownership.
- Real-time text chat, voice, camera, and screen share via LiveKit; speaking/transmitting/connection-quality indicators.
- Optional shared broadcast stage (OvenMediaEngine, Twitch, YouTube, Kick, or a custom URL), off by default.
- Moderation: kick, mute, ban/unban; password lockout (3 failures / 5 minutes); chat flood soft-ban.
- Desktop and mobile layouts (mobile is a separate, first-class layout, not a shrunk desktop).
- UI locales `en`, `pt-BR`, `es`; light/dark design tokens.
- AGPL-3.0-only license with an Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA).
- OKF v0.2 knowledge catalog under `knowledge/` (product, rules, changes).
- `Dockerfile` building a single production image (API + built web app) served on one port, published to Docker Hub as `simstosh/amphitheatre`.
- `deploy/` folder: a self-contained Docker Compose stack (app, LiveKit, Valkey, optional OvenMediaEngine) that does not require cloning the rest of the repository.
- `PUBLIC_APP_HOSTNAME`, `PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_HOSTNAME`, and `PUBLIC_OME_HOSTNAME` environment variables, which derive `CORS_ORIGIN`, `LIVEKIT_URL`, and the OME playback/ingest URLs automatically for self-hosting with a real domain.
- Traefik example (`deploy/docker-compose.traefik.yml`) alongside the existing Caddy profile, documenting which ports must stay published on the host (raw WebRTC/RTMP media) versus which are only reachable through the reverse proxy.
- [Self-hosting guide](docs/self-hosting.md), written for non-developers running their own instance.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag creates a GitHub Release from this file and publishes a multi-arch (`amd64`/`arm64`) image to Docker Hub.
- This `CHANGELOG.md`, following Keep a Changelog, as the macro-history counterpart to the OKF catalog.
- `scripts/extract-changelog.sh promote <version>` command: moves `[Unreleased]` into a dated `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section and refreshes the compare/release links, automating step 1 of the release flow.

### Changed

- `README.md` rewritten in plain language, answering directly whether you need to clone the repo, use only a Compose file, or a single `docker run` (short answer: it depends on whether you want to use the app or develop it — see the guide).

### Fixed

- Multi-arch Docker release build: pin the JS-only `deps`/`build` stages in `Dockerfile` to `--platform=$BUILDPLATFORM` so `pnpm install`/`vite build` run natively on the runner instead of crashing under QEMU emulation ("illegal instruction") while cross-building `linux/arm64`.
