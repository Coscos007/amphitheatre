# Amphitheatre — OKF catalog

Root bundle of this repository: `knowledge/`. Format: **OKF 0.2** ([SPEC](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md)).

Agents: read **product** and **rules** before changing code. After a durable user preference, update [self-aware-knowledge](rules/self-aware-knowledge.md) (create or edit a file in `rules/`). Do not leave the constraint only in chat.

Operational instructions for the repo: [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) at the monorepo root (outside the bundle).

* [OME broadcast](product/ome-broadcast/ome-broadcast.md) - optional OBS ingest; stream key = roomId + secret; opt-in
* [OBS ingest](product/obs-ingest/obs-ingest.md) - OBS encoders, CBR/VBR/CRF, bypass vs transcode
