# Implemented

- LiveKit room **=** Amphitheatre `roomId`. Identity **=** `userId`.
- `GET /api/rooms/:id/livekit-token` and token on join (`livekitToken` / `livekitUrl`).
- Grants: `canPublish` + sources camera, mic, screen. Moderation mute **removes** `MICROPHONE` from `canPublishSources` and calls RoomService `updateParticipant`.[^livekit-api]
- SPA: `livekit-client` (not `@livekit/components-react` in this cut). Custom tiles. Remote **audio tracks are attached** (mic and screen-share audio); video tiles stay on `AttachVideo`. SDK default simulcast.[^hook]
- Devices modal: on desktop, microphone and speaker sit in two columns (select above volume); mic test and the level meter span both columns. Starting the test mutes the published room mic (if it was on), plays a local self-listen loopback, and shows a visible level meter; stopping restores the previous mute state unless a moderator mute is in effect. Camera preview starts only after a tap. Settings → General can request mic and camera on tap so Safari shows a prompt. Dock capture must not await `startAudio()` before `getUserMedia`.
- Screen share requests tab/system audio (`audio` + Chromium `systemAudio: "include"`). Local screen audio is not played back. If the browser rejects the audio constraint, share continues as video-only.
- `room.startAudio()` after connect and on user gestures; toast when autoplay still blocks. Speaking indicators are not treated as proof of audible output.
- SFU: image `livekit/livekit-server:v1.13.5`, UDP mux `7882`, ICE TCP `7881`, Valkey DB 1 (RESP), `max_participants: 50`, no egress.[^yaml]
- Webhook `POST /webhooks/livekit` updates camera/screen in the hub.
- Client emits `presence.update` (speaking, camera, screen, quality).

# Indicators

Speaking, camera, screen, `connectionQuality` mapped to `excellent|good|poor|lost`. See the presence rule.

# Intended / partial

- Room toggles that disable publish on the token: there are **no** `voiceEnabled` fields on create; mute is per member.
- Built-in LiveKit TURN (port 3479) is **commented out**; OME already uses 3478.
- Reconnection: SDK defaults only.
