# What landed

- Media dock in the center of the header; settings + theme + language on the right with tooltip.
- Settings modal with vertical tabs (Devices, About, Stage). Devices in an input/volume and output/volume grid; mic test after the input; `inputVolume` in localStorage.
- About: logo, project GitHub, OME/OvenPlayer/LiveKit/Valkey, Buy Me a Coffee, and portfolio.
- Chat: autosize textarea, send inside the field, max 1024, wrap long text, 1–2 min soft-ban (`PATCH /api/rooms/:id/chat`, `chat_slow` event).
- Tile chrome at the top, visible on hover, hides after 3s.
- 1:1 and full logos; favicon, apple-touch, manifest, og/twitter, room title.

# Why

User QOL request after the room rework: more area for the stage, a usable chat input, controlled flood, and visual identity from the brand files.
