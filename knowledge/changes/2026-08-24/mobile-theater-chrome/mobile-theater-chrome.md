# What landed

- Compact chrome (`pointer: coarse` or `max-width: 767px`): wordmark + Settings + hamburger for theme and locale (Home, join gate, and room). Room title moves to a second header row so controls no longer overlap the logo.
- Mobile dock is a full-width floating bar in the footer (app-style). Compact buttons are icon-only and vertically centered; caption space is not reserved.
- Broadcast enabled but not playing: full-width offline/waiting card sized to its content, not a video tile. Live playback still uses the player tile.
- Settings: Devices sections spaced apart; Stage tab copy fields stack on narrow viewports; visible mic level meter; test mutes the room mic when it was on, enables self-listen, and restores the previous mute state.
- Home: tighter padding and hamburger chrome so the header and form fit a phone width.

# Why

Mobile screenshots showed overlapping header controls, a header dock with empty caption gaps, an offline card trapped in the player, a missing mic meter, and cramped Stage/Devices settings.
