# What landed

- Removed the `pb-24` the stage still reserved for the old dock. Desktop flex chain (`flex-1` + `min-h-0`) and `auto-rows-fr` grid so the stream occupies 100% of the frame height.
- Shared `BrandWordmark` (full horizontal logo) on Home, the room header, and the About tab. The 1:1 circle stays only where a compact avatar/mark makes sense.

# Why

With the dock in the header, bottom padding left an empty strip on the stage. The room still showed the 1:1 icon + “Amphitheatre” text instead of the Home wordmark.
