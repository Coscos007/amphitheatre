# What landed

- Settings modal tabs: Stage (admin only), Devices, About (always last).
- Centered About: description (open-source AGPLv3, Lucas Sims / SIMSDEV), buttons (coffee and portfolio), then Made with (OME 0.21.0, OvenPlayer 0.10.53, LiveKit 1.13.5, Valkey 9.1.1 with license and use). Version `0.1.0`. No API stack paragraph (Bun/Hono).
- Dialog xl with fixed height; header `items-center` + Raleway. Tabs do not scroll; only the tab content does. That removes the double-scroll.
- Reload stream at the top right of the tile, to the left of the pin, on the same 3s hover. The OME failure overlay still keeps the button visible.

# Why

About in the middle and dialog + panel scroll made for poor UX. Reload in the lower corner covered the player and did not follow the pin chrome.
