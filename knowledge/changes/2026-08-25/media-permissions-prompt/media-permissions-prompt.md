description: Settings General can request microphone and camera on tap. Dock media calls do not await startAudio first. Devices preview is click-to-start.

# What landed

Settings → General has Allow microphone and Allow camera, each calling `getUserMedia` in the click handler. Failures are classified (denied, missing device, in use, insecure) with copy that tells the user to allow access or fix Safari / iOS site settings.

Mic, camera, and screen on the dock no longer await `room.startAudio()` before capture (that ate the Safari user-activation token). Devices camera preview no longer starts in a `useEffect`.

# Why

Safari and mobile often returned a permission error without ever showing the system prompt.
