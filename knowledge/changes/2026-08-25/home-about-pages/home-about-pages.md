# What landed

Home has a centered footer nav: **What is Amphitheatre?** (`/what-is`) and **About** (`/about`), plus the existing open-source / no-recording line. Those routes started as a card wrapper around the Settings About panel and a short explainer. They are now full-bleed editorial pages — see [site-editorial-pages](/changes/2026-08-25/site-editorial-pages/site-editorial-pages.md). Copy in `en` / `pt-BR` / `es`. No emoji.

# Why

The About content lived only inside a room Settings modal. New visitors on Home had no place to read what the product is.
