# What landed

- Stage → flood pause uses compact spacing (title + hint, tight radios, save) instead of a sparse fieldset with `min-h-11` rows.
- Devices on desktop: two columns like Discord (mic select + input volume | speaker select + output volume). Mic test and the level meter span both columns. Camera preview stays a block below.
- About shows the semver from the monorepo root `package.json`, injected at Vite build as `__APP_VERSION__`. That is the same value as the GitHub Release / git tag `vX.Y.Z` after the release bump.
- Mobile room header: title left, broadcast badge right on the second row.
- Mobile Audience/Chat tabs sit inside the same `glass-panel` as the conversation (panel radius, not a pill). Expanding still grows the card upward.

# Why

Flood options looked loosely stacked. Devices did not match the Discord two-column voice layout. About was hardcoded `0.1.0` while the tagged release is `1.0.0`. The mobile badge sat under the title; the tab bar was a separate overly-round pill.
