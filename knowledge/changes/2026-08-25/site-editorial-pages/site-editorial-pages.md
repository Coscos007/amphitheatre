# What landed

`/what-is` and `/about` no longer sit in a centered overlay card. The main column is full width: a large display title, a lead in page ink, then a two-column story grid. `/what-is` talks about the gathering, the room, the small-by-design choices, and what is left out — without naming other products. `/about` keeps version, license, author, GitHub, coffee, and software credits, with human descriptions. Settings → About stays the compact modal panel. Copy in `en` / `pt-BR` / `es`.

# Why

A narrow card fought the reading task. Visitors needed a clearer story of what Amphitheatre is for, not a stack dump or a comparison list.
