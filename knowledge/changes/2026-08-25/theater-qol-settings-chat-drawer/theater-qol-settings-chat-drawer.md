# What landed

- Room header (desktop and mobile) shows Settings only. Theme and locale moved to Settings → **General** (first tab). Stage / Devices / About follow. On mobile, Settings is a fullscreen dialog.
- When Chat is not visible, new messages from others show a count badge on the Chat tab and prefix the document title with `(n)`. Opening Chat clears the count. Join history and own messages do not count.
- Mobile Audience/Chat is a floating bar above the dock, closed by default. Tap a tab to expand the panel upward; tap the selected tab again to collapse. The stage fills leftover height when the drawer is closed.
- Mobile camera tiles use a 1–2 column Meet-style grid (no pin rail). An odd leftover tile spans the row.

# Why

The room header was crowded with theme and locale next to Settings. Chat had no unread signal. Mobile Chat/Audience sat above the stage and stole vertical space even when unused. The compact camera grid stacked two people in a single column.
