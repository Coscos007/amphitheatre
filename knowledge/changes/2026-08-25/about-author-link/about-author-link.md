# What landed

Settings → About no longer has a Portfolio button. “Lucas Sims (SIMSDEV)” in the created-by line links to `https://sims.dev.br`. CTAs: Source on GitHub as an outline (`secondary`) button to the repo; Buy me a coffee as the filled (`primary`) button.

# Why

A theater About screen is for version, license, source, and optional support. A Portfolio button next to coffee read as a hiring CTA. GitHub and coffee are both on-mission; coffee stays the filled primary so support is the visual ask, and GitHub is an outline button so the repo stays obvious without matching coffee’s weight.
