# What landed

- Home hero column (title, lead, mood chips) is centered on compact chrome; desktop (`xl`) stays left-aligned.
- Join and create are tabs in the Home panel, matching Audience/Chat in the room. Join is the default tab. Display name stays above the tablist.
- Compact Home header is wordmark + hamburger. The guest avatar is inside the appearance sheet.
- The hamburger (Home, join gate, room) opens a fullscreen native dialog with a close button, not a popover.

# Why

Mobile Home had left-aligned hero copy, two stacked action cards that overflowed, and a header crowded by hamburger plus avatar. The previous appearance menu was a small popover.
