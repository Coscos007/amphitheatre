# What landed

- App icons (192/512 any + maskable, apple-touch, favicons) flattened onto `#2e1b08`. Manifest `background_color` matches; `theme_color` stays the dark shell `#1b110a`.
- Production service worker (`/sw.js`) with a GET `fetch` passthrough so Chromium can install. API/WebSocket paths are not intercepted.
- Compact Home always suggests install (session-dismissible banner). Home hamburger and Settings → General offer **Install as app** until standalone. iOS gets Add to Home Screen copy.
- Invite uses `navigator.share` with title/text in `en` / `pt-BR` / `es` (URL inside the text). Clipboard is the fallback.
- Open Graph / Twitter: `summary_large_image`, 1200×630 image dimensions and alt, Apple web-app meta, `viewport-fit=cover`. Removed the GitHub `canonical` (the live origin is the product URL).

# Why

Users asked for native share on Invite, a first-class PWA with a brown icon background instead of white, and a mobile install path that does not depend on hunting the browser menu.
