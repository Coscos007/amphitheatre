# What landed

- Home in three zones like the HTML: brand, center pill, profile with status dot.
- Hero with line break (`whitespace-pre-line`), 160x120 atmosphere-only cards, `xl:w-[480px]` panel with `p-1`/`p-8`.
- Center pill = theme and locale (not Discover/Library/Create routes).
- `--surface-bright` token for the Join button, matching the prototype's surface-bright.
- Boot fix: `export { initials }` in the header crashed the SPA (empty `#root`).

# Why

Request to compare React with the HTML in the browser and close the Home visual gap, without turning nav/card mocks into features.
