# Rule

Amphitheatre is an **installable PWA** (browser only; no native iOS/Android app). Chromium needs HTTPS (or localhost), a web app manifest, and a service worker with a `fetch` handler. The SW in `apps/web/public/sw.js` is a network passthrough so the app is installable; it does **not** cache the API, WebSockets, or LiveKit. Register it only in production builds. Serve `/sw.js` with `Cache-Control: no-cache`.

**Icons:** raster app icons (any + maskable 192/512, apple-touch 180, favicons) sit on a solid `#2e1b08` canvas, not white or transparent (iOS fills transparency with white). `background_color` in the manifest is `#2e1b08`. Chrome/status `theme_color` stays `#1b110a` in dark (and the light page token when the user picks light). Maskable icons keep the mark inside the inner 80% safe zone.

**Install UI:** while the session is not `display-mode: standalone` (or iOS `navigator.standalone`), compact Home always suggests installing (banner; dismiss is session-only). The Home hamburger includes **Install as app**. The room has no hamburger; the same action lives in Settings → General. iOS has no `beforeinstallprompt`; show Add to Home Screen steps instead.

**Invite:** desktop and mobile Invite uses `navigator.share` when it exists, with title and text in the active UI locale (`en` / `pt-BR` / `es`). Put the room URL **inside the text** (WhatsApp often ignores `url`). AbortError is silent. If share is missing or fails, copy that same text to the clipboard.

Do not invent an offline-first cache, push notifications, or a store listing.
