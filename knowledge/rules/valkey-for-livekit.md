# Rule

The LiveKit RESP store is **Valkey** (`valkey/valkey`, semver-alpine pin), not `redis:` from Redis Ltd.

- Image and container: `valkey/valkey:9.1.1-alpine`, `coliseum-valkey`, `valkey-server` + `valkey-cli`.
- Compose hostname stays `redis` (`redis:6379` in the LiveKit YAML). Do not rename the service just so it “looks like Valkey” — LiveKit only speaks RESP.
- Conf in `infra/redis/redis.conf`, mounted at `/usr/local/etc/valkey/valkey.conf`. `maxmemory-policy noeviction`. Volume `coliseum-valkey-data` (do not reuse a Redis Ltd. dump — RDB v12).
- The API **does not** persist rooms/roles in that store (SQLite). Do not revert to Redis Ltd. for “compatibility”.

Reason: Valkey is BSD-3-Clause (Linux Foundation). Redis 8+ is RSALv2 / SSPL / AGPLv3 — worse for commercial SaaS-style use. Protocol is drop-in for LiveKit.
