# Rule

While the guest **is in the room** (`joined`), leaving requires the confirmation modal already used in the dock (Leave). That applies to:

- click on the logo / mark in the header
- Leave button in the dock
- in-app navigation to another route (including SPA history back)

Confirmed: `POST /api/rooms/:id/leave`, clear the room store, and go to Home (or the blocked route). Cancel keeps the room.

Do not show the modal on JoinGate or on 404: the person has not joined yet. Native browser `beforeunload` stays off; the custom modal does not replace the system dialog when closing the tab.
