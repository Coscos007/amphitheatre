description: Safari and mobile often skip the mic/camera prompt unless getUserMedia runs in the tap handler. General settings must offer explicit Allow buttons and honest errors.

# Rule

Do **not** call `getUserMedia` from a `useEffect` (Devices preview used to). Safari/iOS often returns `NotAllowedError` without showing a prompt if the call is not in the same user gesture, or if `startAudio()` was awaited first and consumed the activation token.

Dock mic/camera/screen: call LiveKit `setMicrophoneEnabled` / `setCameraEnabled` / `setScreenShareEnabled` **before** `room.startAudio()`. Classify failures (`denied`, `not_found`, `in_use`, `insecure`) and toast the matching copy; point the user at Settings → General.

Settings → **General** has **Allow microphone** and **Allow camera** buttons that call `getUserMedia` on click (audio and video **separately**), then stop the tracks. Copy must explain that if no dialog appears, the site is already blocked in browser / iOS Safari settings.

Devices camera preview starts only after a tap on **Start camera preview**. Mic test already requires a tap.
