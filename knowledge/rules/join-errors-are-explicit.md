# Rule

An invite link `/rooms/:id` must open the **join gate** when the room exists, including private and password-protected rooms. `GET /api/rooms/:id` returns **404 `not_found` only when the id is missing**. Existence is not hidden behind a fake 404 for private rooms. Non-members get the public preview (`id`, `name`, `hasPassword`, …) **without** `members`.

`POST /api/rooms/:id/join`:

| Situation | Error |
|---|---|
| Room id does not exist | `not_found` (404). Does **not** count as a lockout strike. |
| Password missing or wrong | `invalid_password` (403), public or private. Empty password does not lock out. Wrong password still uses the 3-strike lockout. |
| No display name | Client validation + `join.needName`. Do not map this to a password error. |

The legacy code `cannot_join` stays in `errorCodes` but the API no longer emits it for missing rooms or wrong passwords. The SPA must not treat `cannot_join` as “wrong password”.

Room ids use a mixed-case alphabet. The Home code field must **not** use `text-transform: uppercase` (that only changes the look and makes people doubt the code). Disable mobile autocapitalize on that input.
