# Rule

Every feature or fix gets a bullet under `## [Unreleased]` in the root `CHANGELOG.md`, in English, using [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) categories (`Added` / `Changed` / `Fixed` / `Removed`). This is in **addition** to the OKF change bundle in `knowledge/changes/`, not instead of it — the OKF bundle is the detailed record, `CHANGELOG.md` is the macro one a human skims before upgrading.

Releasing a new version is a **manual** flow, never automatic on merge to `main`:

1. Run `scripts/extract-changelog.sh promote X.Y.Z` to move `[Unreleased]`'s content into a new `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section (leaves `[Unreleased]` empty above it and refreshes the link references at the bottom).
2. Bump `version` in the root `package.json` to match. Settings → About reads that value at Vite build (`__APP_VERSION__`); do not hardcode a different string in the SPA.
3. `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push --tags`.
4. `.github/workflows/release.yml` extracts that version's section (`scripts/extract-changelog.sh`) to create the GitHub Release (always English), then builds and pushes a multi-arch (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`) image to Docker Hub as `simstosh/amphitheatre:vX.Y.Z`, `:X.Y`, and `:latest`.

Do not tag, release, or push to Docker Hub without the user explicitly asking in that message — this is a variant of the "no upstream PRs / no unrequested releases" discipline already in `AGENTS.md`.
