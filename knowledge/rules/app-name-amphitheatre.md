# Rule

The app name is **Amphitheatre**. Use that spelling (English) in `en`, `pt-BR`, and `es` (`app.name`), in `<title>`, in the meta description, in the Home wordmark, and in README / AGENTS / knowledge prose.[^i18n][^html]

Do not revert to "Coliseum Theater" in visible copy.

Technical identifiers **do not** need to be renamed under this rule: packages `@coliseum/web`, `@coliseum/api`, `@coliseum/shared`, git folder, Zustand keys, cookies. Only change those if the user asks for an identifier rename.
