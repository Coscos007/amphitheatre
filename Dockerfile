# Amphitheatre — single image with the API (Hono/Bun), the theater SPA, and the operator SPA.
#
# The API serves the compiled theater from apps/api/public on PORT 3001 and the
# operator console from public-admin on ADMIN_PORT 3002. LiveKit and (optionally)
# OvenMediaEngine still run as separate containers — see docs/self-hosting.md.
#
# Build:  docker build -t amphitheatre .
# Run:    docker run -p 3001:3001 -p 127.0.0.1:3002:3002 -v amphitheatre-data:/app/data amphitheatre

# ---- deps: install the full pnpm workspace (needed to build the web app) ----
#
# --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM pins these JS-only build stages to the runner's
# native architecture even when cross-building for another target (e.g.
# building linux/arm64 on an amd64 GitHub Actions runner). Node/pnpm running
# under QEMU user-mode emulation can crash ("illegal instruction") during
# install/build; nothing here produces architecture-specific output, so
# there is no correctness downside. Only the final `runtime` stage below
# stays pinned to the real $TARGETPLATFORM.
